Create an object from using the "election" class.

The data that is extracted will be stored in a field called "election_data". 

```{r}
Sweden_election<-election()

Sweden_election$election_data
```

Now clean the data so that it can be in the right format. This needs to be done before calling the shiny app. 

```{r}
Sweden_election$clean()

Sweden_election$election_data
```

To view all the parties invloved.

```{r}
Sweden_election$party()
```

The shiny app can be called by running: runGitHub("Siddhesh19991/shinyapp")
