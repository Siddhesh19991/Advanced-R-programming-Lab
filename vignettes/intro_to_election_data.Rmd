Create an object from using the "election" class.

The data that is extracted will be stored in a field called "election_data". 

```{r}
Sweden_election<-election()

Sweden_election$election_data
```

Now clean the data so that it can be in the right format.

```{r}
Sweden_election$clean()

Sweden_election$election_data
```


## post this, the shiny app can be called.
